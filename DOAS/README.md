# Digital Image Processing and Analysis - Jupyter projects

##### Those are the exercises I did in class DOAS - "Digitalna obrada i analiza slike", or in english: "Digital Image Processing and Analysis". The exercises are done by writing the code in the jupyter file. The instructions for the exercises are in the jupyter file.

---
## Lab 1 - (`DIPA_LAB_1_TOMISLAV_ČUPIĆ.ipynb`) 

##### In this exercise we learned how to represent, plot images in Jupyter and we used some basic operations on them. 

### Features:
   * Learning 
   * Unary and binary operations
   * Quantization
   * Sampling and Pixelization
   * Alias and Moire effect

 To run the Jupyter notebook you need to connect to google drive with the images, and then click run all

## Lab 2 - (`DIPA_LAB_2_TOMISLAV_ČUPIĆ.ipynb`)

##### In this exercise we transformed some images and enhanced them. We learned about different filters and histograms. 

### Features:
   * Discrete Fourier transform and Image Filtering
   * Discrete Cosine Transform and Image compressing
   * First order histogram
   * Histogram equalization and modeling
   * Filtering and unsharpness removal


 To run the Jupyter notebook you need to connect to google drive with the images, and then click run all

##### I haven't done the Lab 3 so it is not here

## Lab 4 - (`DIPA_LAB_4_TOMISLAV_ČUPIĆ.ipynb`)

##### In this exercise we learned about image segmentation and image registration. 

### Features:
   * Amplitude segmentation
   * Local and global thresholds
   * Extraction of edges
   * Texture segmentation
   * Image reegistration
   * Optical flow
