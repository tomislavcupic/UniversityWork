# Information Processing - Jupyter notebooks

##### These are the laboratory exercises I did in class: OBRINF - "Obrada informacija", which is in english: "Information Processing". I haven't done the third exercise, so there are 1st, 2nd and 4th. In the folders, there is a .pdf file with instructions and a pdf file with solutions. The first one was about

## Lab 1 - Signal processing

##### In the first exercise we had to analyse the water levels of Sava River over the period of 25 years, we learned to use the fourier transform and wavelet families. The point of it was to learn to identify and explain the basic techniques of signal processing.

### Features:
   * Extracting the key features from data
   * plotting the water level
   * Discrete and short time fourier transform
   * Continuous wavelet families

#### Requirements - NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.fft, signal from scipy, pywt

## Lab 2 - Bioinformatics

##### In the second exercise we had to analyse the escherichia coli genome in FASTA format, and the set of sequencing reads in FASTQ format. Key point to learn is extraction of main features and key points to work with data in bioinformatics.

### Features:
   * Extracting the key features from data
   * Giving the nucleotids numbers and creating a signal from it
   * correlation of reference and first reading
   * dynamic programming algorithm

#### Requirements - NumPy, biopython

## Lab 4 - Computational finance

##### In the fourth exercise we had to analyse the prices of securities on financial market. We were given the ETF-s, and we had to do the PCA method and calculate the proprietary portfolios. 

### Features:
   * correlation and return covariance matrix
   * volatility and mean returns
   * PCA method
   * proprietary portfolios

#### Requirements - pandas, os, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy

## TODO:
   * add python code for fourth exercise
   * add english versions of second and fourth exercise
