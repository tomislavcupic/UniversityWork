# Script languages

##### These are the exercises I have done in class "Skriptni jezici", or in english: "Script languages". Laboratory exercise one was in bash, while the second one was in perl. The third exercise is soon to be added, which was written in Python. Instruction for every task is in the Labx folder.

## Lab 1

##### In the first exercise we learned how to use the script language "bash". We used basic operations, regular expressions and wrote simple bash scripts.

## Features:
   * Shell variables and command line expansion
   * Loops and groupings
   * Grep, find commands
   * traversing and synchronizationing of directories

## Lab 2

##### In the second exercise we learned how to use the other script language "perl". It was similar to the first one, using some basic operations, and writing some short scripts.

## Features:
   * Handling inputs and loops
   * extracting key points from data 
   * word counters and regex

## Lab 3

##### The third exercise was to learn how to do scripts using Python. This exercise is missing

## TODO:
