# Parallelism and Concurrency

###### Here is the laboratory exercise I did in class PIK - paralelizam i konkurentnost, or in english: Parallelism and Concurrency.

## ABOUT

###### The project was to make two versions of numerical integration using the Monte Carlo method. We were supposed to solve the integration of F(x) = sin(x) / x in boundaries: [a, b] = [0, 10]. First version is implemented with one thread, and the other with multiple threads using the OpenMP library. The files are written in c.

## Features:
   * Monte Carlo method
   * OpenMP library
   * Numeric integrations
