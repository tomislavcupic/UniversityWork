# Seminar - project

##### This is a project that I made for my "seminar" class, where we had to do a little project and make a presentation on it. The project is in python file, the document and the presentation is also in this folder. The presentation and the seminar is currently avaiable only in croatian, but I will change that later.

## About the project

###### The project I made was simulation of the ecosystem, and I wanted to check if the genetic algorithms are a good representation of evolution of genes in real life. I created two to three different species of animals, where one were predators, while the other two were herbivores. Then I changed some attributes like vision and speed.

## Features:
   * Genetic algorithms
   * Genes - speed, vision, energy, thirst
   * Predators, herbivores
   * Species in groups and without them

##### It is made using python and pygame.

## TODO:
   * add all versions of the project
   * Add english versions of the presentation and seminar
