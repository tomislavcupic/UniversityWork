These are the laboratory exercises I did in class: OBRINF - "Obrada informacija", which is in english: "Information Processing".
I haven't done the third exercise, so there are 1st, 2nd and 4th.
In the folders, there is a .pdf file with instructions and a pdf file with solutions. In there is also the code written in python.

TODO:
   * add python code for fourth exercise
   * add english versions of second and fourth exercise
