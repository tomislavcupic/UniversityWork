# Operational research

##### Here is the laboratory exercise from the class "Operational research", or in croatian - "Operacijska istraživanja". The exercise text is in the instructions.docx file, together with the results. The graf.png image is the matplotlib of the solution of the task. 

## About the laboratory exercise

#### The laboratory exercise was about Linear programming, we were given the task and had to solve it using Python, specifically Pulp and numpy libraries.

## Features:
   * Linear programming
   * Simplex algorithm
   * Shadow prices

##### You can run the program by running the task.py file. It will print out the optimum number, shadow prices and plot the graph of the solution.
